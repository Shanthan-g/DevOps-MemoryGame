# Spe-MemoryGame
A fun matching game where you can test how good your memory is and hone your cognitive functions like attention span, concentration and focus.
A grid of tiles will be displayed initially. When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down.
The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. If the two tiles have the same image, they remain face up, else they will be flipped face down again after a short delay. Flip all the cards as fast as you can to win the game.
